indonesia’s social protection policies and systems. a central feature of the program is that it provides support to the community welfare policy assistance team (formerly known as tnp2k policy team), a policy think tank which provides evidence-based policy advice and coordination across a range of goi ministries and agencies. this longstanding partnership has contributed to australia and indonesia’s joint goals to address poverty and inequality and reduce barriers to inclusive economic growth. proaktif has two outcomes, first, to facilitate the community welfare policy assistance team (formerly known as tnp2k policy team) in making an effective contribution to reforming and improving poverty alleviation programs; and second, to optimize the community welfare policy assistance team

advis kebijakan berbasis bukti, serta melakukan koordinasi antar kementerian dan lembaga pemerintah indonesia dalam merumuskan kebijakan. kemitraan yang telah berlangsung lama ini berkontribusi pada tujuan bersama australia dan indonesia dalam mengatasi kemiskinan dan ketimpangan serta mengurangi hambatan bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi yang inklusif. program proaktif memiliki dua tujuan, pertama
